## ✨ FINAL WORDS

### Remember:

**You are more than your interview.**  
This is one conversation on one day. Your worth as a physician and person is not defined by this single event.

**Authenticity > Perfection.**  
Programs want to see the real you—your passion, your humanity, your growth. Don't try to be perfect; be genuine.

**Trust your preparation.**  
You've put in the work. You know your material. You have compelling stories. Trust yourself.

**The right program will want YOU.**  
Not everyone is the right fit for every program, and that's okay. The programs that rank you highly are the ones where you'll thrive.

### You've got this. 💪
